This game was made for the Ludum Dare 47 Compo. The theme was ' Stuck in a loop​'.

---

As usual I only had a few hours to spare so I came up with something simple: An endless runner in a circle.

Controls:
Jump - Space / Button south on controller (hold to jump higher)
Slide - Ctrl / LB on controller (hold to slide longer)

Tools used:
- Unity
- paint.net
- boscaceoil
- sfxr
